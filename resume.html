        <p class="intro-paragraph">Welcome to my portfolio! This page is an accumulation of my learnings and
        skills in my journey to become a Front-end developer. This page will change from time to time as I learn
        new features. Once I am confident in my HTML and CSS knowledge, I will begin learning Javascript to make this
        site more responsive and user friendly!

          I am a recent graduate from The University of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio. I graduated with a Bachelor's of
          Business Administration in Information Systems and a minor in Management and Information Security. One
          of my top classes throughout my four years at UT was my Intro to Web Development class. It mainly focused on
          HTML and CSS and the last week was a little intro to Javascript. While I didn't know it then, I know now that
          I want to become a full-time Web Developer!
        </p>

      <div class="Goals">
        <p class="goals-paragraph">
          My first goal is to become proficient enough in HTML and CSS that I can replicate almost any website I visit
          on my own. From there, I want to be able to fully immerse myself in the Javascript language. Front-end Developer
          is the position I want to hold first. Eventually, I want to learn back-end as well and become a Full Stack Developer!
